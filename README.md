Goalstrive 
================================

Goalstrive as a web application that allows users to break their larger milestone goals (such as buying a house, or starting a new career) into smaller, more achievable goals.



## Summary 

The user's experience begins at the home page, where they are given a brief description about the app. They are encouraged to start their Goalstrive journey by clicking the "Get Started" button below the synopsis. If they already have an account, there is prompt to "Log in" below the Get Started button. Below these options, there is (will be) more information about the application and about why it is important to break down one's goals into smaller goals. This information is displayed so that the user doesn't feel cornered into getting started right away. They can browse the homepage and gain some more insight about the app before making the decision to get started/sign up.
