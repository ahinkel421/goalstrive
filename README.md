Goalstrive 
================================

Goalstrive as a web application that allows users to break their larger milestone goals (such as buying a house, or starting a new career) into smaller, more achievable goals. On Goalstrive, we refer to those larger milestone goals as "Destination Goals." The smaller more achievable goals that make up the Destination Goals, we refer to as "Checkpoint Goals."



## Summary 

The user's experience begins at the home page, where they are given a brief description about the app. They are encouraged to start their Goalstrive journey by clicking the "Get Started" button below the synopsis. If they already have an account, there is prompt to "Log in" below the Get Started button. Below these options, there is (will be) more information about the application and about why it is important to break down one's goals into smaller goals. This information is displayed so that the user doesn't feel cornered into getting started right away. They can browse the homepage and gain some more insight about the app before making the decision to get started/sign up.

If the user decides to sign up for an account and clicks the "Get Started" button, they will be taken to the following sign up form where they can create a new user. Upon submitting their new username and password, they will be added to the database and will be able to sign in and sign out, using those credentials, at their leisure.

Initially upon creating an account and logging in, the user will not have any Destination Goals saved. Therefore, they will be taken to the following page where they can jump right in and create their first Destination Goal, or take a moment to consider their options. Below the "Create new goal" button, the user is given some friendly suggestions to get them started. At the bottom of the screen, there is an inspirational quote to keep the user motivated (will generate different quote every time in V2 of this app).

Once the user has their goal in mind and clicks the "Create new goal" button, they will be taken to the "New Destination Goal" form. The three required fields to submit a goal are the Destination (goal), the ETA (due date), and a brief description of the goal to reflect on why it is they want to achieve that goal.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

When a new Destination Goal is submitted, the user is taken to their Destination Goals page. Here they will find a list of all of the Destination Goals they have submitted. Below their list of goals, there is a "Create new destination goal" button, which will take them back to the "new goal" submission form.

&nbsp;

The arrows to the right of each goal are clickable and will collapse that specific goal to display more information and allow the user to add corresponding "Checkpoint Goals."
